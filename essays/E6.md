<strong>1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</strong>

For Assignment3, I created a website that sells products boba drinks. There are five different drinks and three different sizes for each.

<strong>2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</strong>

I could not add the system to remove items from the shopping cart

<strong>3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</strong>

Using session to keep tracking what products and how many products users put in the shopping cart. 

<strong>4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:</strong>

I created codes, but I deleted them accidentally. Also, I could not create the same one because I kept trying many codes and I did not understand well.

<strong>5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</strong>

I started to work on assignment 3 earlier than assignment 2. Also, I tried to ask the professor for help to fix problems as soon as possible.

<strong>6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</strong>
I tried to search for the solution on google. However, when I really could not solve the problem, I asked professor Port for help. 

<strong>7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</strong>

I did not take too much time to create the code of setting email after checkout. 

<strong>8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</strong>

I could not set the alert for invalid quantities well.

<strong> 9. What did you learn from doing this assignment? </strong>

It is really good to start to work on the assignment earlier. I felt totally different to work on the assignment. It is really easy to feel anxious and irritating which working on an assignment. However, if I have enough time to work on it, I can take enough breaks and try it later. Also, I do not need to be irritated. 

<strong> 10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change? </strong>

I would like to learn every code carefully and try to understand it one by one. Now, I have so many codes that I need to review. However, if I understand the importance of every code, and study more carefully when the semester just started, I think I can be more creative in building my web page. Even though this course is almost finished, I would like to use my summer vacation to review all the code to get ready for the next semester. 

<strong> 11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging </strong>

10% for (a) thinking about how to do something
30% for (b) writing code 
60% for (c) testing and debugging

<strong> 12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</strong>

I worked on assignment 3 by myself.
