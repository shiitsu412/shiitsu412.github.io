  My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

  I believe my programming skills and my understanding of it have greatly improved compared to the beginning of this semester. 
  In the beginning, I was confusing about the difference in languages, such as HTML, Javascript, and CSS. However, through many assignments and practices, I started figuring out what kinds of rules those languages have and how those languages work with what kinds of code.
  Also, my understanding of code improved a lot. In the beginning, I could not even understand which codes make my web page changed. Even I had tried to do it without screencasts when I do homework, I completed most of the homework by watching the screencast after all because I cannot finish by myself. However, based on many WODs and especially Assignment1, I think my understanding of code increased. 
  I understood it just will make me more tired if I tried to copy the code I do not know. I should understand the meaning of all code in my file because even one slash, one dod, or one word, can mess up my whole code. Curiously, if I use only codes I know, that makes me feel I did the work easily.

  I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

  There are several skills I do not understand, but I am actually not really sure what skills I do not understand. Therefore, I should review every programming skill by watching all lecture videos.
  Sometimes, there is a problem with my code, and my web page does not work as I wish. It can take me 5 or 6 hours easily to try to fix the problem. However, if I ask Professor Port for help, he will find the problem of code in a few minutes. That really made me feel it is like magic, but the professor said it is not magic. That words made me feel I really need to practice more and review all skills I learned to be able to find and fix the problems by myself. I really need more efforts and time to spend on improving my programming skills. 

  I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first:

  I believe that my skills and knowledge are improving step by step, but I still need more practice and time to be able to complete WODs without screencasts.

  The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

  I am able to complete most of the labs, but I am still confused about the hits and spins part. Therefore, I need to go through lab 6 again. 

  I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1):

  I would like to review all labs and WODs again before starting working on new assignments, but I feel ready to learn new skills and spend time to improve my skills. 

  I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

  To be honest, due to the lack of my English skills, I really cannot understand lectures well by attending classes once. To acquire new skills and knowledge from classes, I think I should review the lecture video twice to learn as much as possible. 

  These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:

  In classes, Professor Port teaches us the basic ideas of everything, such as what requesting HTTP-server is, why, and how to use URL address in the browser. That knowledge is really helpful to learn code and use it.
