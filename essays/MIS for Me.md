I am an international student majoring in Finance. I had studies for three years, but I realized how important MIS is last year due to the COVID19. What happened in last year changed a whole world. Nobody thought a world would be affected by such one virus that much. Vaccines might be able to remove the COVID19 from now on, but we never know viruses like COVID19 attack us again. Also, to avoid contacts with other people, more people get food by using more delivery apps, and more restaurants adopt AI robots. Obviously, COVID19 acknowledged people, including me, the needs of technology.
